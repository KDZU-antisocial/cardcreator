# Card Creator

A Python tool for automatically creating track review cards from Bandcamp URLs. This tool scrapes track information, downloads images, and generates markdown files in a format suitable for the [KDZU Astro website](http://kdzu.org). The generated markdown files are used to create track review pages on the website, with proper frontmatter and image handling.

## Features

- Scrapes track information from Bandcamp URLs
- Downloads track artwork
- Generates markdown files with frontmatter
- Supports Spotify and YouTube integration
- Configurable output paths for images and markdown files
- Uses modern Python tooling (uv, pip-tools)
- Integrates with KDZU Astro website for track reviews
- Automatically posts track reviews to Instagram with custom hashtags

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Chrome browser (for Selenium)
- Instagram account (for posting)

## Website Integration

This tool is specifically designed to work with the [KDZU Astro website](http://kdzu.org). The generated markdown files and images are structured to work seamlessly with the website's Astro-based static site generation:

- Markdown files are saved to `~/Documents/GitHub/kdzu-org/src/content/tracks`
- Images are saved to `~/Documents/GitHub/kdzu-org/public/images/tracks`
- Frontmatter is formatted to match the website's content schema
- Images are optimized and stored in the correct location for the website

The generated content will appear on the website as track review pages with:
- Track artwork
- Artist and label information
- Bandcamp link
- Spotify and YouTube embeds (when available)
- Track review content
